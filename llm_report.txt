Issue ID: 3680e0d6cadd14ee:1
Rule Violated: py/insecure-temporary-file
Rule Description: Creating a temporary file using this method may be insecure.
Suggested fix: 1) The issue in the code context provided is that the function `tempfile.mktemp()` is used. This function is deprecated in Python because it creates a temporary file in a manner that can be insecure. The function can create a security risk because it does not ensure that the file's creation is atomic. This means that there can be a time gap between the time the file is created and when it is used, which opens the possibility for an attacker to intervene.

2) The recommended fix is to use the `tempfile.mkstemp()` function instead, which creates a temporary file in a secure manner. Here is how the fixed code would look:

```python
    if len(argv) > 1:
        raise app.UsageError('Too many command-line arguments.')
    if FLAGS.save_model_path:
        save_model_path = FLAGS.save_model_path
    else:
        fd, save_model_path = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.saved_model')
        os.close(fd)

    signature_def_map, init_op, assets_collection = create_signature()

    sess = tf.Session()
```
Please note that `mkstemp()` returns a tuple containing an OS-level handle to an open file (as would be returned by `os.open()`) and the absolute pathname of that file, in that order. Therefore, we need to close this file descriptor after we get the path.

3) The fix is the best solution because `tempfile.mkstemp()` creates a temporary file in the most secure manner possible through its guarantees that no two processes can get the same file and that the file is created without any time window for an attacker to hijack the file. This function is not deprecated and is the recommended way to create temporary files in Python.
